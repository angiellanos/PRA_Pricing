## Insurance Pricing for Fire and Home Theft Coverage
This project focuses on insurance pricing models for the following types of coverage:

1. Partial Fire Damage – Estimating premiums for partial property damage due to fire.
2. Total Fire Damage – Pricing for full property loss in case of fire.
3. Home Theft – Calculating premiums for home theft coverage.
   
The models are built using generalized linear models (GLMs) and take into account various risk factors, such as location, type of construction, usage of the property, and safety measures in place. Each model is tailored to estimate the frequency and severity of claims for different levels of coverage.
